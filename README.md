# Shiny App: COVID-19 Case proportions by County in Ireland 2020

In my study of R for data analytics during my HDip part of our assessment was a group project. Our topic was to analyse a dataset of COVID-19 case data broken down by county in Ireland. One of my many contributions to this project was a shiny app that would allow for easy visualisation of the cases per 100,000 metric in each county, on a given date in 2020. Adjusting the slider will accordingly see the levels in each county change graphically.
